   "specialty": "Epilepsy",
   "yearsAtVCU": "15 years total - 9 years on faculty",
   "training": "Medical school and transitional year internship in NY, Neurology residency followed by Clinical Neurophysiology and Epilepsy fellowships at VCU",
   "hometown": "Originally from NYC (Queens), but Richmond has been home since 2011",
   "richmondFavorite": "Generally much easier lifestyle compared to large metropolis but still has some city amenities. Currently favorite restaurant is Lost Letter/Lilian. Hidden gem in town is J Emerson Fine Wine and Cheeses which is taken over by the original shop owner's son who was a teacher by trade. Wife and I try to regularly attend wine school on certain evenings which has really enhanced how I think about the chemistry and geology of where wine comes from how that impacts taste/aroma, etc. Probably the best park IMO is still Pocahontas State Park but I used to live walking distance from Brown Island during training - this does get very crowded when weather is nice making biking there a little sketchy.",
   "media": "Just watched Squid Game season 3. Wife and I are also trying to watch the entire Star Wars movie TV saga in canon order... I flip flop what music I listen to way too much but generally stick to European trance, progressive, DnB to get energized but also chill lo-fi stuff to relax. Last several tracks on my playlist were by Nujabes, Qdesza, Purity Ring, Pendulum, FooR, Bru-C, Sub Focus, Armin van Buuren, Digable Planets, Fred Again...",
   "hobby": "Probably favorite general hobby is cooking and trying out new recipes - I am a terrible baker as I do not necessarily cook with precision and more by feel/taste. I like pretty much any type of cuisine - I very much appreciate the craft of chefs particularly through exploring various Michelin Star restaurants - which gets very expensive... I have been teaching myself how to sail for the past 5 or so years and have some reach aspirations to live on board a large catamaran or ocean passage some day. I have also picked up sim racing, though I'm not very good at it. I've been a huge fan of Formula 1 since I was a kid and now spend way too much money traveling to races...",
   "alternateProfession": "This has evolved as I've gotten older, but I do keep going back to seeing myself as a chef - initially starting small with a food truck, but perhaps a traveling restaurant on a boat? Though born and raised in NYC, I'm of Japanese descent and have grown up with many other ethnicities and cuisine. Proper ramen, curry, fried chicken are the original Japanese comfort foods that I think are still missing in the Richmond area.",
   "coffeeOrder": "If you haven't figured by now, I have become very bougie as I've gotten older. My coffee is relatively simple - home-made straight espresso or over ice during the summer. I do love a good affogato (espresso over vanilla gelato) or honey latte. I don't actually consider myself a coffee snob, just frugal - I splurged on a Breville Barista Express 10 years ago which is still going strong - it paid itself off in our household within 3 months. Calculate how much money you would save by not drinking Starbucks during the work week for 3 months and you'll see what I'm talking about. During the winter I'll go back to old reliable Japanese genmai-cha (toasted rice green tea).",
   "bestPartOfJob": "I get to play with really neat toys (EEG equipment, neurostimulators) to treat medication resistant epilepsy.",
   "likesAboutResidents": "Residents are always thirsty for knowledge so working with them really keeps me on my toes and encourages me to stay on top of my game. Having done my training at VCU, I also have a deep connection with what it's like to be resident here.",
   "advice": "Always strive to be most open minded and humble person in the room.",
   "ahaMoment": "There was a reason why your physiology professor lectured you ad nauseum about the action potential cycle - we modulate that at the microscopic level with most of the medications we prescribe. Once you know that cold, you will appreciate the madness of anti-seizure medication polypharmacy.",
